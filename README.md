# <a name="top">GRACE Alerting</a>

GRACE Alerting provides basic CloudWatch Event Rules and Log Metric Filters that assist with the monitoring of an AWS environment. Results are dispatched to the provided email address using AWS Simple Notification Service, providing a minimalistic alert monitoring solution.

## Security Compliance
The GRACE Alerting subcomponent provides various levels of coverage for several [NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Rev. 4) Security Controls](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/impact/moderate).  These security controls are designated for [FIPS 199 Moderate Impact Systems](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.199.pdf). Additional information regarding the implementation method utilized can be found within the [GRACE Component Control Coverage Repository](https://github.com/GSA/grace-ssp/blob/master/README.md).
**Component ATO status:** draft

**Relevant controls:**

Control    | CSP/AWS | HOST/OS | App/DB | How is it implemented?
---------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ----------------------
[AC-2(g, h)](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AC-2) | ╳ | | | Employs the use of CloudWatch Event Rules to continuously monitor for root login events and modifications to the IAM configuration for the system environment.  The event information captured from the CloudWatch Event Rules is formatted and passed on to a user-defined email recipient via the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).
[AC-2(4)](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/AC-2#enhancement-4) | ╳ | | | A CloudWatch Event Rule is used to continuously monitor for IAM actions related to account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal. The event information captured from this CloudWatch Event Rule is formatted and passed on to a user-defined email recipient via the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).
[CM-6(d)](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev4/control/CM-6) | ╳ | | | The use of CloudWatch Event Rules provides partial coverage for the monitoring of system configurations related to the following services and resources: S3 bucket access and permissions, CloudTrail settings, AWS Config settings, and IAM configurations. There are CloudWatch Event Rules available that can also provide monitoring and alerting on compliance status changes to AWS Config Rules and send notifications on any system findings generated by the Amazon GuardDuty service.

| disable_or_delete_kms_key | Alert when a KMS Key is disabled or scheduled for deletion | 
| console_signin_without_mfa | Alert when a user signs into the AWS Console without using multi-factor authentication | 


### Events

| Rule Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| scp_changes | This event rule is only useful when your account is also the AWS Organization's Master Account.  Alert on Attach, Detach, Update, Disable, and Enable Service Control Policies and Types |

# Usage

Simply import grace-alerting as a module into your Terraform for the destination AWS Environment.

```
module "alerting" {
    source                    = "github.com/GSA/grace-alerting?ref=v0.0.1"
    cloudtrail_log_group_name = "<log_group_name>"
    recipient                 = "<email_address>"
}
```
